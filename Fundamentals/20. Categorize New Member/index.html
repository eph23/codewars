        <h1>JavaScript Exercise â€“ Categorize New Member</h1>
        <p>
            The Western Suburbs Croquet Club has two categories of membership,
            Senior and Open. They would like your help with an application form
            that will tell prospective members which category they will be
            placed. To be a senior, a member must be at least 55 years old and
            have a handicap greater than 7. In this croquet club, handicaps
            range from -2 to +26; the better the player the lower the handicap.
        </p>
        <p>
            Input Input will consist of a list of pairs. Each pair contains
            information for a single potential member. Information consists of
            an integer for the person's age and an integer for the person's
            handicap.
        </p>
        <p>
            Output Output will consist of a list of string values (in Haskell
            and C: Open or Senior) stating whether the respective member is to
            be placed in the senior or open category.
        </p>
        <p>
            Example input = [[18, 20], [45, 2], [61, 12], [37, 6], [21, 21],
            [78, 9]] output = ["Open", "Open", "Senior", "Open", "Open",
            "Senior"]
        </p>
